HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is one of the most common forms of code in the world. It is used on pretty much every single web page in existence, and it allows web designers to present text, images, videos, and other content in a clear, concise manner. Naturally, many beginners choose this language to learn first, yet find the difficulty to understand what is the best way to learn HTML.

If you want to become a front-end web developer, learning HTML is essential. Luckily for you, there are hundreds of websites out there teaching you HTML basics that will allow you to build a simple HTML page. However, these websites don’t always teach you the best or most efficient way of how to learn HTML. They don’t always teach the most up to date version of the language, and they don’t always teach you everything that you need to know.
